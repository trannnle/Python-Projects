# 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository! This collection includes a range of data science and machine learning projects built using Python, with a focus on real-world datasets and business applications.



## 📂 Project Folders

### 🔹 [Churn and Poison Prediction Models](./Churn%20and%20Poison%20Prediction%20Models)
Predictive models for customer churn and churn-with-poison scenarios using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN.

### 🔹 [Customer Spending Prediction Model](./Customer%20Spending%20Prediction%20Model)
Regression models that forecast customer spending based on demographic and behavioral variables. Includes regularized models and performance visualization.

### 🔹 [Digital Magazine Customer Segmentation](./Digital%20Magazine%20Customer%20Segmentation)
Unsupervised learning project using clustering techniques (e.g., KMeans, GMM) to segment digital magazine users based on engagement patterns.

### 🔹 [Spotify Song Performance Analysis](./Spotify%20Song%20Performance%20Analysis)
Exploratory data analysis and visual storytelling project that investigates how songs perform across platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and TikTok using chart metrics and playlist reach.
